# Shader Park Next Website

This is an early build out of the new Shader Park website.
The existing website is live [here](https://www.shaderpark.com/) and the origional website source code can be found [here](https://github.com/shader-park/shader-park-website).

The origonal website started as a 3D enviornment and shader-park-core was origonally in the website. As the website and library has changed over time there were growing pains and it makes sense to re-build out the core funcitonality.
